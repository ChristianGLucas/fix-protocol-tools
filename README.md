# fix-protocol-tools

Deterministic parsing, decoding, and integrity validation of **FIX** (Financial
Information eXchange) protocol messages — FIX 4.2/4.4/5.0, the dominant
electronic-trading messaging standard. Built for the [Axiom](https://axiomide.com)
marketplace, published under the `christiangeorgelucas` handle.

A FIX message is a SOH-delimited (`0x01`, often shown as `|` or `^A`) sequence
of `tag=value` fields, e.g.:

```
8=FIX.4.2|9=178|35=D|55=AAPL|54=1|38=100|44=25.50|10=123
```

This package tokenizes that wire format and pairs it with an **embedded FIX
data dictionary** — tag number to field name, message-type codes, and
enumerated field-value meanings, hand-compiled from the public FIX 4.2/4.4
specification — to decode messages, extract and validate the standard header
and common order fields, extract repeating groups, and verify the
BodyLength/CheckSum wire-integrity fields.

Every node is a pure, deterministic single-input to single-output transform:
no network, no FIX session/socket, no wall-clock, no randomness. The FIX
message is always supplied as text by the caller.

## Nodes

- **ParseFields** — parse a message into an ordered list of `{tag, value}` fields (SOH/`|`/`^A`).
- **ParseToMap** — parse a message into a `tag -> value` map.
- **GetFieldByTag** — get one field's value by its numeric tag.
- **GetFieldByName** — get one field's value by its dictionary name (e.g. `"Symbol"`).
- **DecodeMessage** — decode a message with human-readable field names attached.
- **GetMsgType** — extract and decode MsgType (tag 35), e.g. `"D"` -> `"NewOrderSingle"`.
- **GetHeaderFields** — extract the standard header (8/9/35/49/56/34/52).
- **GetOrderFields** — extract and decode common order fields (55/54/38/44/40/59).
- **DecodeEnumValue** — decode any tag/value pair to its enumerated meaning.
- **ValidateBodyLength** — validate declared BodyLength (tag 9) against the actual byte length.
- **ValidateCheckSum** — validate declared CheckSum (tag 10) against the computed value.
- **ComputeCheckSum** — compute the correct CheckSum for a message body.
- **SplitLog** — split a concatenated FIX log into individual messages.
- **ExtractRepeatingGroup** — extract a repeating group (e.g. NoMDEntries) as structured entries.
- **GetFixVersion** — identify the FIX protocol version from BeginString.
- **ListTags** — list every distinct tag present.
- **CountFields** — count total field occurrences vs. distinct tags.
- **ClassifyMessage** — classify a message as admin, application, or unknown.

## Notes on CheckSum

CheckSum is computed over the **literal bytes** of the input you supply,
including its delimiter. SOH (`0x01`) and `|` are different byte values, so
the same logical message rendered with `|` instead of a real SOH byte has a
genuinely different checksum. If you need the checksum that would appear on
the real wire, supply the real SOH-delimited bytes.
